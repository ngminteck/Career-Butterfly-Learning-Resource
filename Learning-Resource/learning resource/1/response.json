The number `27`\nis written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.\n\nRoman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right.\nHowever, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is\nwritten as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making\nfour. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`.\nThere are six instances where subtraction is used:\n\n  * `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. \n  * `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. \n  * `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.\n\nGiven a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.\n\n\n\nExample 1:\n\n    \n    \n    Input: s = \"III\"\n    Output: 3\n    Explanation: III = 3.\n    \n\nExample 2:\n\n    \n    \n    Input: s = \"LVIII\"\n    Output: 58\n    Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.\n    \n\nExample 3:\n\n    \n    \n    Input: s = \"MCMXCIV\"\n    Output: 1994\n    Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.\n    \n\n\n\nConstraints:\n\n  * `1 <= s.length <= 15`\n  * `s` contains only the characters `('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M')`.\n  * It is guaranteed  that `s` is a valid roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`.\n\n",
