experiment_id is the column with unique values for this table.
platform is an enum (category) type of values ('Android', 'IOS', 'Web').
experiment_name is an enum (category) type of values ('Reading', 'Sports', 'Programming').
This table contains information about the ID of an experiment done with a random person, the platform used to do the experiment, and the name of the experiment.

<p>Write a solution to report the <strong>number of experiments</strong> done on each of the three platforms for each of the three given experiments. Notice that all the pairs of (platform, experiment) should be included in the output <strong>including</strong> the pairs with <strong>zero experiments</strong>.</p>

<p>Return the result table in <strong>any order</strong>.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;result format is in the following example.</p>
