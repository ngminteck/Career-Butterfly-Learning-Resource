<p><strong>SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications)</strong> is a crucial system that powers most international money and security transfers. Let‚Äôs delve into what SWIFT does and how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Purpose and Function</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>SWIFT is a vast messaging network used by financial institutions to securely send and receive information related to <strong>money transfer instructions</strong>.</li>
<li>It enables individuals and businesses to make electronic or card payments even if the customer or vendor uses a different bank than the payee.</li>
<li>SWIFT is the <strong>largest and most streamlined method</strong> for international payments and settlements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How SWIFT Works</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each member institution is assigned a unique <strong>ID code</strong> known as a <strong>Bank Identifier Code (BIC)</strong>.</li>
<li>The BIC consists of either eight or eleven characters and provides information about the bank name, country, city, and branch.</li>
<li>For example, the Italian bank <strong>UniCredit Banca</strong> has the BIC code <strong>UNCRITMM</strong>:
<ul>
<li>First four characters: Institute code (UNCR for UniCredit Banca)</li>
<li>Next two characters: Country code (IT for Italy)</li>
<li>Next two characters: Location/city code (MM for Milan)</li>
<li>Last three characters (optional): Used to assign codes to individual branches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When a customer wants to send money internationally, their local bank uses SWIFT to transmit a payment transfer message to the recipient‚Äôs bank.</li>
<li>The recipient bank receives the SWIFT message and processes the incoming payment, crediting it to the recipient‚Äôs account.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Important Points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>SWIFT is <strong>not a financial institution</strong>; it facilitates secure communication between member institutions.</li>
<li>More than <strong>11,000 global SWIFT member institutions</strong> send an average of <strong>44.8 million messages daily</strong> through the network.</li>
<li>While SWIFT is crucial to global financial infrastructure, it does not hold or transfer assets directly.</li>
</ul>
